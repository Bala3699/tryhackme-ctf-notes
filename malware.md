# Malware Analysis – HopHelper.exe (TryHackMe Lab)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on malware analysis using static and dynamic analysis techniques. The goal is to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), persistence mechanisms, and network behavior of a Windows malware sample (HopHelper.exe) in a sandboxed environment.

## Objectives
- Understand malware behavior using static and dynamic analysis.  
- Extract file metadata, strings, and imports.  
- Monitor registry and process activity for persistence and communication.  
- Translate findings into actionable defensive insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- PeStudio  
- Regshot  
- Process Monitor (ProcMon)  
- Windows Registry  
- Sandbox / Virtual Machine  
- TryHackMe Lab Environment  

## Step-by-Step Malware Analysis

### 1. Static Analysis
- Load HopHelper.exe into PeStudio.  
- Extract SHA256 hash, strings, imports, and indicators of compromise.  
- Note suspicious URLs, IPs, or commands.  

### 2. Dynamic Analysis
- Take a registry snapshot using Regshot.  
- Execute HopHelper.exe in a sandbox environment.  
- Take another registry snapshot and compare to identify persistence keys.  
- Monitor process behavior and network activity using ProcMon.  
- Filter logs to focus on relevant operations (e.g., TCP connections, registry writes).  

### 3. Findings
- **SHA256:** F29C270068F865EF4A747E2683BFA0 
- **Flag in strings:** THM{STR}  
- **Registry persistence key:** HKU\S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1008\Software\Microsoft\  
- **Network protocol used:** HTT 

## Key Outcomes
- Successfully identified malware indicators of compromise (IOCs).  
- Monitored persistence mechanisms and network communications.  
- Applied safe malware analysis techniques in a sandboxed environment.  

## Resume-Ready Description
Performed hands-on malware analysis on a Windows sample using static and dynamic techniques. Extracted SHA256 hash, strings, registry changes, and monitored process/network activity to provide actionable threat intelligence.

## Notes
- All analysis was performed in a safe, isolated environment (sandbox/VM).  
- Malware files are **not included** in this repository for security reasons.  
- Screenshots or logs of tool outputs can be added for demonstration purposes.
